The files "chainanalysis.py" and "polymerAB.py" are python3 code which contain the BondReader class
which are used to calculate quantities of interest from simulation output, including chain and block 
length distributions, degree of polymerization, reaction extent, dispersity, etc. 

The BondReader class operates on files output from simulation, and is used to produce the '.pickle' files 
stored in the main directory which are used to generate figures. 

The file "interior_exterior.py" is a python3 analysis script used to identify monomers belonging to the interior
and exterior of aggregated regions and determine the relative fraction and composition of monomers in these 
populations. It utilizes the output data files of the LAMMPS simulation as its input.

The file "rdf_scripy.py" is a python3 analysis script used to calculate the radial distribution from the
output data files of a LAMMPS simulation.

The file "barrcalc_v2.py" is a python3 analysis script used to calculate the total energy of a monomer-monomer
interaction at the time of bond formation for all bonding events in the system, which is used to determine the
activation energy as described in the Supplemental Information of the publication.

The full set of simulations used in this work are not included due to 
space constraints, but are available from corresponding authors on request.
